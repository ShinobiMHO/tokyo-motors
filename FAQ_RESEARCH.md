## 🇺🇸 TOP 30 QUESTIONS USA (triées par fréquence/importance)

### CATÉGORIE 1 : LÉGALITÉ & RÉGLEMENTATION

---

**Q1. Is it legal to import a Ferrari / Lamborghini / Porsche from Japan to the USA?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Yes, it's completely legal. European luxury cars sold on the Japanese market (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, McLaren, Bentley, etc.) are European-manufactured vehicles — not JDM-only models. They were originally built to meet international safety and emissions standards. This means EPA and DOT compliance is significantly simpler compared to true JDM-only vehicles. We handle all documentation, EPA Form 3520-1, and DOT Form HS-7 as part of our service. Every car we export arrives legally registered in your name.

---

**Q2. What is the 25-year rule, and does it apply to my car?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
The 25-year rule (per the Motor Vehicle Safety Act) allows any vehicle over 25 years old to be imported to the USA without needing to meet current FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) or EPA emission standards. For example, a 1998 Ferrari F355 is now fully eligible. However, Tokyo Motors specializes primarily in **newer luxury vehicles** (2000s to present) which do **not** qualify under the 25-year rule. These vehicles require EPA/DOT compliance. Because we handle European supercars built to international specs, the compliance process is well-established and manageable — unlike obscure JDM models. We guide you through every step.

---

**Q3. Does a Japanese-market Ferrari or Lamborghini meet US EPA/DOT standards?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
European luxury cars sold in Japan (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, McLaren) were manufactured to meet European emissions standards (Euro 5/6), which are comparable to US EPA standards. While they don't come with the exact US-spec labels, they can be certified through an **Independent Commercial Importer (ICI)** or through manufacturer compliance letters. For major marques like Ferrari and Porsche, manufacturer compliance documentation is often available. We work with experienced ICI partners to handle this efficiently. Costs typically range from $2,000–$6,000 for a major European supercar — significantly less than for true JDM vehicles with no compliance pathway.

---

**Q4. What are the import duties/taxes on a supercar from Japan to the USA?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Per US Customs and Border Protection (CBP):
- **Passenger cars: 2.5%** of the declared value (e.g., $5,000 on a $200,000 Ferrari)
- **Trucks/SUVs: 25%** (rarely applies to supercars)
- **No additional luxury tax** at federal level

State sales tax is due at registration in your home state. Note: import duty is based on the purchase price, not the US market value. Buying a Ferrari at auction in Japan for ¥12,000,000 (~$80,000) and importing it means duty on $80,000, not the US retail value. This is one of the significant financial advantages of importing from Japan.

---

**Q5. What is the total cost to import a supercar from Japan to the USA?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Here is a realistic cost breakdown for a luxury supercar (e.g., $80,000–$200,000 purchase price):

| Item | Estimated Cost |
|------|---------------|
| Japan auction buyer's premium | 5–8% of hammer price |
| Export agent (Japan) | $850–$1,200 |
| Inland transport in Japan | $200–$500 |
| Ocean freight (Japan→US port) | $1,500–$3,000 |
| US port fees & handling | $300–$600 |
| Customs broker fee | $300–$500 |
| US import duty (2.5%) | ~$2,000–$5,000 |
| EPA/DOT compliance | $2,000–$6,000 |
| Tokyo Motors service fee | Contact us |
| State registration | Varies by state |

**Total on-top-of-purchase costs: typically $8,000–$18,000** depending on the vehicle and destination state. We provide a complete cost estimate before you commit.

---

**Q6. How long does the entire process take, from bidding to having the car in my driveway?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Typical timeline:
- **Auction & purchase**: 1–2 weeks (depends on finding the right car)
- **Japan export prep & loading**: 2–4 weeks
- **Ocean freight** (Japan to US West Coast): 3–4 weeks; East Coast add 1–2 weeks
- **US customs clearance**: 1–2 weeks
- **EPA/DOT compliance work** (if needed): 2–6 weeks
- **Title processing**: 4–6 weeks after compliance

**Total: approximately 3–5 months** from start to title in hand. We communicate with you at every stage and send photos/videos throughout. Rush options exist for certain compliance pathways.

---

**Q7. Can I drive the car while waiting for the title?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
This varies by state. Most states issue temporary permits or transit plates that allow limited driving while the title is processed. Some states (e.g., California) have specific rules. Once EPA/DOT compliance is complete and customs cleared, we apply for the US title directly in your name. It typically arrives 4–6 weeks after the car is cleared. We can advise on your specific state's rules.

---

**Q8. How do Japanese car auctions work? Can I see the car before bidding?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Japan has a highly developed auction system with major houses including USS, TAA, JU, Aucnet, and HAA Kobe (which specializes in imports and left-hand drive). Each vehicle receives a detailed inspection grade:
- **Grade 4.5 / 5**: Excellent condition, minimal to no blemishes
- **Grade 4**: Very good, minor surface marks
- **Grade 3.5**: Good condition with some minor cosmetic issues
- **Grade R/RA**: Repaired accident history — we avoid these for supercars

You don't physically visit, but you receive:
- Detailed inspection reports (translated to English by us)
- Multiple high-resolution photos
- Mileage verification
- Service history notes
- Any known defects listed

For luxury supercars, we also arrange **pre-purchase inspections by independent Japanese specialists** upon request. We only bid on cars that meet our quality standards.

---

**Q9. What are the risks of buying at Japanese auction?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
The main risks — and how we mitigate them:

1. **Hidden damage**: Auction grades can miss interior/mechanical issues. Mitigation: We use only reputable auction houses + offer independent pre-purchase inspections.
2. **Odometer fraud**: Rare in Japan (strict regulations), but we verify via service records.
3. **Compliance surprises**: Some vehicles are more complex to comply. Mitigation: We assess compliance risk BEFORE you bid.
4. **Currency fluctuation**: JPY/USD can move. Mitigation: We give you a locked total estimate and move quickly once you decide.
5. **Losing a bid**: We may not win the first auction. Mitigation: We bid on multiple lots and find you the right car — often within 2–4 auctions.

Japan's auction system is actually one of the most **transparent and regulated** used car markets in the world. Dealers there face severe penalties for misrepresentation.

---

**Q10. Why is a Japanese-market Ferrari/Lamborghini/Porsche cheaper than in the USA?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Several factors create this price differential:
1. **Japanese depreciation culture**: Japanese car owners trade in frequently, creating supply
2. **Strong yen in past decades**: Cars were bought at high JPY, now sold cheaper
3. **Right-hand drive stigma**: Some Japanese luxury cars are right-hand drive, reducing their resale value in Japan (but perfectly fine for countries driving on the left, or as a collector/track car)
4. **Low-mileage examples**: Japanese owners typically drive less than US owners
5. **Market conditions**: Japan has an oversupply of premium used vehicles

Example: A 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia might sell at Japanese auction for ¥15–18M (~$100–120K), while the same car in excellent condition retails for $130–160K in the US.

---

### CATÉGORIE 2 : PROCESSUS & LOGISTIQUE

---

**Q11. Do I need to be physically in Japan to buy the car?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
No. We handle the entire process remotely on your behalf. You never need to visit Japan. We source the vehicle, bid at auction, handle all Japanese export paperwork, ship the car, and manage US customs and compliance. You simply communicate with us via email or phone, approve bids, and wait for your car to arrive.

---

**Q12. How does payment work? Is it safe to send money overseas?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
We use secure international wire transfers and work with established Japanese financial partners. Our process:
1. You pay a **deposit** to initiate the search
2. Upon winning at auction, we invoice you for the full Japan purchase amount (payable within 48–72 hours)
3. Remaining service fees are invoiced upon US arrival

We are a registered US business (state of [X]). We provide full invoicing and can assist with letters of credit for larger transactions. We are happy to provide references from past clients.

---

**Q13. Can I finance the purchase of a Japanese import supercar?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Financing imported vehicles can be challenging through traditional banks, as the title process takes time. Options include:
- **Cash purchase** (most common for supercars)
- **Personal/business loan** from your bank secured against other assets
- **Specialty exotic car finance** companies (some will finance once the US title is in hand)
- **We have financing partners** who work with imported exotics — ask us for current options

---

**Q14. Which US ports do you ship to?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
We primarily ship to **Port of Los Angeles (San Pedro), Port of Seattle/Tacoma, Port of Baltimore, and Port of New Jersey/Newark**. We can arrange delivery to any US port and handle inland transportation to your door or a preferred facility anywhere in the continental US. Alaska and Hawaii shipping available at additional cost.

---

**Q15. What documentation will I receive with the car?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
You will receive:
- **Japanese Export Certificate** (Yushutsu Shomeisho) — proving legal export from Japan
- **Bill of Lading** — shipping documentation
- **US EPA Form 3520-1** — emissions compliance declaration
- **US DOT Form HS-7** — safety standards declaration
- **US Customs Entry Summary** — CBP clearance documentation
- **ICI compliance certificate** (if applicable)
- **US Title in your name** (issued by your state DMV)
- **Vehicle history report** translated from Japanese
- Any available **original Japanese service records**

---

**Q16. What happens if the car is damaged during shipping?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
All vehicles are shipped with **marine cargo insurance**. We use RoRo (Roll-on/Roll-off) shipping for driveable vehicles, which is the safest method — cars are driven on/off the ship rather than lifted by crane. In the rare event of damage, marine insurance covers repairs. We document the vehicle's condition thoroughly before loading, with photos and video.

---

### CATÉGORIE 3 : SPÉCIFIQUE SUPERCARS

---

**Q17. Are Japanese-market Ferraris different from US-spec Ferraris?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Japanese-market Ferraris are typically Euro-spec vehicles imported to Japan by Ferrari's Japanese distributor. They share the same mechanical platform as Euro/global-spec cars. Key differences from US-spec:
- **Speedometer in km/h** (can be recalibrated or dual-display)
- **Headlight adjustment** may need minor modification
- **Potentially right-hand drive** on some older models
- **Emissions documentation** in Japanese (we handle translation and compliance)

For most modern Ferraris (post-2000), the difference is minimal and compliance is straightforward.

---

**Q18. Can I import a car under 25 years old without EPA/DOT compliance? (Show & Display exemption)**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Yes, for **historically significant vehicles** that are not eligible for the 25-year rule. The **Show and Display exemption** (established by NHTSA) allows certain vehicles of unique historical or technological significance to be imported and driven up to 2,500 miles/year. This applies to specific models deemed collectible (e.g., certain McLaren F1 variants, rare Ferrari special editions). Approval requires a NHTSA petition. We can assess whether your target vehicle qualifies. Note: this limits road use significantly.

---

**Q19. What is an ICI (Independent Commercial Importer) and do I need one?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
An ICI is an EPA-registered company authorized to modify and certify vehicles for US emissions compliance. For European supercars sold in Japan, ICI work often involves:
- Certifying that the vehicle's emissions system meets EPA standards
- Minor software or hardware modifications if needed
- Issuing a compliance label

For **European-origin supercars** (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, McLaren), the ICI process is typically streamlined because these manufacturers have established EPA compliance documentation for their global models. Costs: $2,000–$6,000 depending on model. We work with trusted ICI partners.

---

**Q20. Are right-hand drive cars legal to drive in all US states?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
**Yes.** All 50 states permit right-hand drive (RHD) vehicles on public roads. There is no federal prohibition, and no state bans them. Insurance is available from specialty insurers (Hagerty, Grundy, Adrian Flux USA). The main practical consideration is toll booths and drive-through windows — minor inconveniences for a supercar owner!

---

**Q21. Will I save money buying a supercar from Japan vs. buying locally in the USA?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Often yes — significantly. The savings depend on the model:
- **Ferrari 458**: Japanese auction ~$100–130K | US market ~$140–180K. Savings after import costs: $20,000–$40,000
- **Lamborghini Huracán**: Similar differential of 15–25%
- **Porsche 911 GT3**: Japan often 20–30% below US prices for comparable spec
- **McLaren 720S**: Japan market can be 15–25% below US

Factors that affect savings: model rarity, yen/dollar rate, compliance complexity. We run the numbers for you before you commit.

---

**Q22. What is the auction grade system in Japan?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Japanese auction grades are issued by certified inspectors at the auction house:

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| S / 6 | New or near-new condition |
| 5 | Excellent — minimal wear |
| 4.5 | Very good — very minor cosmetic marks |
| 4 | Good — minor cosmetic issues |
| 3.5 | Above average — some light scratches/dents |
| 3 | Average — noticeable cosmetic issues |
| 2 | Poor — significant cosmetic damage |
| 1 | Heavy damage |
| RA | Repaired accident damage |
| R | Accident history, not fully repaired |

For supercars, we target **Grade 4.5 and above**. Grade 4 is acceptable for certain models if priced accordingly. We never source Grade R/RA for our clients.

---

**Q23. How do I know the mileage is real? Is odometer fraud common in Japan?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Odometer fraud is significantly less common in Japan than in other markets due to strict regulations and cultural norms around honesty in transactions. Additionally:
- Japanese Shaken (vehicle inspection) records track mileage at each inspection (every 2 years)
- Auction inspection reports note any inconsistencies
- Service records show mileage at each service visit
- Modern vehicles have electronic odometers that are harder to tamper with

We cross-reference Shaken records with auction reports for every vehicle. Mileage discrepancies are a red flag we take seriously.

---

**Q24. Can I request a specific car or model? Or do I choose from your existing inventory?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Both options are available:
- **From inventory**: We maintain a curated selection of pre-sourced vehicles ready for export
- **Custom sourcing**: Tell us exactly what you want (model, year, color, spec, mileage), and we search the entire Japanese auction network — thousands of cars per week — to find your perfect match. Custom sourcing typically adds 2–4 weeks to the timeline.

---

**Q25. What warranty do I get on an imported vehicle?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
We are honest about this: imported used vehicles do not come with manufacturer warranties (those are void outside the original market). However:
- We offer a **comprehensive pre-export inspection** on every vehicle
- We recommend **specialist extended warranty programs** for exotic cars (companies like CARCHEX, Endurance, or exotic-specific providers)
- Many European supercar dealers in the US will service Japanese-market vehicles — they're the same mechanical platform
- Factory Ferrari/Lamborghini/Porsche service centers accept these vehicles

---

**Q26. What is "Shaken" and why does it matter?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Shaken (車検) is Japan's mandatory vehicle inspection, required every 2 years (annually for older vehicles). It's significantly more rigorous than most US state inspections. A car with fresh Shaken has been recently certified for roadworthiness by the Japanese government. We note Shaken status for every vehicle. A car with remaining Shaken validity demonstrates it was recently maintained and in good condition — it's a positive quality indicator.

---

**Q27. Do you handle the import for Tesla or electric vehicles from Japan?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Yes. Japanese-market Teslas and other EVs (including some domestic Japanese EV models) can be imported. Tesla vehicles sold globally are largely identical mechanically, making compliance simpler. Note that charging standards may differ (Japan uses CHAdeMO; US uses CCS/Tesla Supercharger) — we advise on any adapter needs. Battery health reports are available for most EVs sold at Japanese auction.

---

**Q28. What if I'm not happy with the car when it arrives?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
We provide full transparency at every step. Before we bid, you approve the specific car based on our translated inspection report, photos, and our written assessment. Once shipped, returns are not possible (the car is yours upon auction purchase). This is why our **pre-bid consultation is thorough** — we help you understand exactly what you're buying. For cars with issues post-arrival that were not disclosed in the auction report, we pursue compensation from the auction house on your behalf.

---

**Q29. Are there any cars you won't import?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
We don't import:
- Vehicles with salvage/flood titles (Grade R/RA)
- Vehicles where EPA/DOT compliance is cost-prohibitive or impossible
- Stolen vehicles (all exports require valid Japanese deregistration documents)
- Vehicles subject to OFAC sanctions

We also advise against certain models where US compliance costs would eliminate the financial advantage of buying from Japan.

---

**Q30. How do I get started?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
1. **Contact us** with your desired vehicle (or browse our inventory)
2. We provide a **free cost estimate** with full breakdown
3. You pay a **small search deposit** to begin sourcing
4. We find vehicles matching your criteria and present options
5. You approve, we bid
6. Upon winning, you wire payment within 48 hours
7. We handle everything — export, shipping, customs, compliance
8. Car arrives at your door, title follows

**Timeline: approximately 3–5 months. We communicate with you every step of the way.**

## 🇫🇷 TOP 20 QUESTIONS FRANCE (triées par fréquence/importance)

### CATÉGORIE 1 : LÉGALITÉ & RÉGLEMENTATION

---

**Q1. Est-ce légal d'importer une supercar depuis le Japon en France ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Oui, c'est tout à fait légal. L'importation de véhicules d'occasion depuis des pays tiers (dont le Japon) est permise en France et dans l'Union Européenne, sous réserve de respecter les démarches douanières et d'homologation. Les supercars européennes vendues au Japon (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, McLaren, Bentley) sont des véhicules d'origine européenne — elles peuvent être réceptionnées à titre isolé (RTI) en France de manière plus directe que les véhicules purement japonais. Nous gérons l'intégralité du processus pour vous.

---

**Q2. Qu'est-ce que la Réception à Titre Isolé (RTI) et est-ce obligatoire ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
La RTI (Réception à Titre Isolé) est la procédure administrative permettant d'immatriculer en France un véhicule qui n'a pas été homologué sur le marché européen lors de sa mise en circulation. Pour les supercars européennes importées du Japon (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche vendues sur le marché japonais), la RTI est **obligatoire** pour obtenir la carte grise française. La procédure implique :
- Dossier technique complet transmis à la DREAL ou au service compétent
- Tests UTAC (sécurité, émissions, freinage, etc.)
- Pour les véhicules post-2006 : test d'émissions (simplifié si équivalence, prototype si aucune équivalence)
- Passage du contrôle technique
- Demande de carte grise via ANTS

Nous prenons en charge la totalité de cette procédure avec nos partenaires homologateurs.

---

**Q3. Quel est le coût total pour importer une supercar du Japon en France ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Voici une estimation réaliste pour une supercar de luxe (prix d'achat 50 000€–150 000€) :

| Poste | Coût estimé |
|-------|------------|
| Frais d'enchères japonaises | 5–8% du prix marteau |
| Agent d'export (Japon) | 800€–1 200€ |
| Transport intérieur Japon | 200€–400€ |
| Fret maritime Japon→France | 1 500€–2 500€ |
| Droits de douane UE (6,5%) | 3 250€–9 750€ sur une voiture à 50 000€–150 000€ |
| TVA à l'importation (20%) | 20% sur (valeur + fret + douanes) |
| Frais de port et dédouanement | 500€–1 000€ |
| RTI / Homologation | 2 000€–8 000€ selon le véhicule |
| Frais Tokyo Motors | Nous contacter |
| Carte grise | Selon puissance fiscale et région |

**⚠️ Important** : Le malus écologique peut être très élevé pour les supercars. Voir Q8.

---

**Q4. Quels sont les droits de douane pour importer une voiture du Japon en France ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Pour l'importation de véhicules neufs ou d'occasion depuis le Japon (pays hors UE) :
- **Droits de douane : 6,5%** de la valeur en douane (prix d'achat + fret + assurance)
- **TVA : 20%** sur (valeur en douane + droits de douane)

Exemple pour une Ferrari 458 achetée 80 000€ :
- Fret et assurance : ~2 000€
- Valeur en douane : 82 000€
- Droits de douane (6,5%) : 5 330€
- Base TVA : 87 330€
- TVA (20%) : 17 466€
- **Total taxes à l'import : ~22 800€**

L'accord commercial UE-Japon (en vigueur depuis 2019) a réduit progressivement les droits sur certains véhicules, mais les voitures d'occasion restent soumises à 6,5%.

---

**Q5. Qu'est-ce que le malus écologique et comment s'applique-t-il sur une voiture importée ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Le malus écologique ("malus CO2") est une taxe française due lors de la première immatriculation en France d'un véhicule. Il s'applique de la même façon aux véhicules importés d'occasion lors de leur première immatriculation française.

**Barème 2024–2025 (indicatif)** :
- À partir de 123 g/km de CO2 : le malus commence
- 200 g/km : environ 10 000€
- 250 g/km : environ 30 000€
- 300 g/km+ : peut dépasser 50 000€

Pour les supercars :
- Ferrari 458 (~320 g/km CO2) : malus potentiellement **50 000€–60 000€+**
- Lamborghini Huracán (~290 g/km) : malus **40 000€–50 000€**
- Porsche 911 Carrera (~200 g/km) : malus environ **5 000€–15 000€**
- Porsche 911 GT3 (~230 g/km) : malus environ **20 000€–30 000€**

**Important** : Le malus peut être plafonné à 50% de la valeur du véhicule (règle "orphelin"), mais cette règle a évolué. Nous calculons le malus précis pour chaque véhicule avant votre décision.

---

**Q6. L'homologation d'une Ferrari ou Lamborghini achetée au Japon est-elle possible en France ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Oui. Les Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren et autres supercars européennes vendues sur le marché japonais peuvent être homologuées en France via la procédure RTI. Avantages :
- Ce sont des véhicules d'origine européenne (construits par Ferrari SpA, Lamborghini SpA, etc.)
- Les données techniques sont disponibles auprès des constructeurs
- La plupart des modèles ont des équivalences émissions reconnues par l'UTAC

Pour les véhicules mis en circulation après le 01/01/2006, un test d'émissions est nécessaire. Pour les grandes marques européennes, une **équivalence pollution** est souvent reconnue (test simplifié à ~200€ au lieu de ~1 400€ pour un prototype pur JDM), ce qui rend la procédure bien plus accessible.

---

**Q7. Combien de temps prend le processus d'importation du Japon vers la France ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Calendrier typique :
- **Enchères et achat** : 1–3 semaines
- **Préparation export au Japon** : 2–4 semaines
- **Fret maritime** (Japon → port français : Le Havre, Marseille) : 5–7 semaines
- **Dédouanement** : 1–2 semaines
- **RTI / Homologation** : 4–12 semaines selon le véhicule
- **Carte grise** : 1–3 semaines après homologation

**Total : environ 4–7 mois** du début à la livraison avec carte grise française.

---

**Q8. Le malus écologique ne rend-il pas l'importation non rentable ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
C'est une question légitime. Pour les supercars fortement émissives, le malus peut effectivement être très élevé. Notre approche honnête :

**Cas où l'import reste avantageux** :
- Voitures rares ou de collection (faible disponibilité sur le marché français)
- Modèles avec malus modéré (Porsche 911, certains McLaren hybrides, GT sportives)
- Client avec statut professionnel permettant des montages fiscaux

**Cas où l'import est moins intéressant** :
- Supercars avec émissions >250 g/km et malus >40 000€
- Sauf si le prix japonais est suffisamment inférieur pour absorber ce coût

**Nous calculons le coût total réel** (prix + douanes + TVA + malus + homologation) vs le prix français du même véhicule **avant** toute décision. Transparence totale.

---

### CATÉGORIE 2 : PROCESSUS & LOGISTIQUE

---

**Q9. Dois-je me déplacer au Japon pour acheter le véhicule ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Non. Nous gérons l'intégralité du processus à distance. Vous n'avez jamais besoin de vous rendre au Japon. Nous identifions les véhicules correspondant à vos critères dans les maisons d'enchères japonaises, vous présentons des rapports d'inspection traduits en français, et n'enchérissons qu'avec votre accord. Toute la communication se fait par email, téléphone ou WhatsApp.

---

**Q10. Le véhicule sera-t-il en conduite à droite ou à gauche ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
La plupart des véhicules vendus au Japon sont en **conduite à droite** (volant à droite), ce qui est la règle au Japon où la circulation se fait à gauche.

Cependant, de nombreuses supercars européennes vendues au Japon sont disponibles en **conduite à gauche** (volant à gauche), car ces voitures ont été exportées depuis l'Europe vers le Japon en version gauche. Ferrari, Lamborghini et Porsche ont notamment de nombreux exemplaires gauche au Japon.

Conduire une voiture à droite est légal en France mais demande une adaptation (dépassements, péages). Si vous souhaitez absolument une conduite à gauche, nous le spécifions dans la recherche — cela peut réduire le choix mais reste possible.

---

**Q11. Les voitures japonaises sont-elles fiables ? Y a-t-il plus de problèmes mécaniques ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Les supercars européennes vendues au Japon (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche) sont soumises au Shaken japonais (contrôle technique obligatoire biannuel très strict). Les propriétaires japonais sont réputés pour leur entretien rigoureux. Le marché japonais produit régulièrement des véhicules avec :
- Kilométrage faible (moyenne japonaise inférieure à la moyenne européenne)
- Historique d'entretien documenté
- Aucun rouillage (climat japonais tempéré, moins de sel routier)

Les risques mécaniques ne sont pas supérieurs à un achat d'occasion en Europe — souvent inférieurs. Nous fournissons un rapport d'inspection complet traduit et recommandons une inspection indépendante sur les pièces spécifiques si souhaité.

---

**Q12. Comment fonctionne le paiement ? Est-ce sécurisé d'envoyer de l'argent au Japon ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Nous sommes basés au Japon (Tokyo) et opérons comme société légalement enregistrée. Le flux de paiement est :
1. **Acompte** pour démarrer la recherche

**Q13. Quelle est la différence entre un véhicule "neuf au sens douanier" et un véhicule d'occasion ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Au sens des douanes européennes, un véhicule est considéré "neuf" s'il a moins de 6 mois ou moins de 6 000 km. Cela affecte le traitement TVA :
- **Véhicule neuf (douanes)** : TVA obligatoirement collectée à l'importation, aucune récupération possible
- **Véhicule d'occasion** : TVA sur la marge du vendeur possible sous certaines conditions

La plupart des supercars que nous importons sont des véhicules d'occasion au sens douanier. Nous précisons ce statut dans nos devis. Pour les acheteurs professionnels, des optimisations fiscales peuvent être possibles — consultez votre expert-comptable.

**Q14. Quels papiers vais-je recevoir avec le véhicule ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Vous recevrez :
- **Certificat d'exportation japonais** (déregistration officielle du véhicule au Japon)
- **Bill of Lading** (connaissement maritime)
- **DAE/mainlevée douanière** (preuve de dédouanement)
- **Procès-verbal de RTI** (homologation française)
- **Certificat de conformité RTI** permettant l'immatriculation
- **Historique d'entretien japonais** (traduit)
- **Rapport d'inspection de l'enchère** (traduit)
- **Carte grise** (délivrée par l'ANTS après immatriculation)

---

**Q15. Y a-t-il une garantie sur le véhicule importé ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
La garantie constructeur d'origine est généralement expirée ou non transférable pour des supercars d'occasion importées. En revanche :
- **Garantie légale de conformité** : en tant que vendeur professionnel, nous sommes soumis aux obligations légales françaises (2 ans pour les défauts cachés, selon le Code de la consommation)
- **Inspection pré-expédition** : nous effectuons un contrôle approfondi avant embarquement
- **Extension de garantie** : nous pouvons vous orienter vers des garanties mécaniques tierces spécialisées en supercars (Opteven, Autosphere, etc.)

**Q16. Puis-je importer une voiture japonaise récente (moins de 10 ans) ? Est-ce homologable ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Oui, les véhicules récents sont homologables, mais le processus est plus complexe et coûteux que pour les anciens modèles. Points clés :
- **Post-2006** : test d'émissions obligatoire à l'UTAC (200€ avec équivalence, 1 400€+ sans équivalence)
- **Post-2011 (Euro 5)** : les supercars européennes vendues au Japon ont souvent une équivalence reconnue
- **Véhicules hybrides et électriques** : procédure simplifiée car conformité technique évidente

Pour les Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche post-2010, la RTI est généralement réalisable et rentable. Nous évaluons chaque modèle au cas par cas et vous donnons une estimation précise des frais d'homologation avant engagement.

**Q17. Le contrôle technique d'une voiture japonaise pose-t-il des problèmes spécifiques ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Le contrôle technique français (CT) s'applique normalement à toutes les voitures, quelle que soit leur origine. Les points de vigilance spécifiques aux imports japonais :
- **Feux** : les normes de feux au Japon sont légèrement différentes — les optiques doivent être vérifiées et parfois ajustées
- **Compteur** : doit afficher km/h (si en mph ou km/h selon l'origine) — généralement déjà en km/h pour les japonaises
- **Ceintures de sécurité** : conformes aux normes ECE
- **Limiteur de vitesse** : non requis en France

Pour les supercars européennes (Ferrari, Lamborghini, etc.), le CT est généralement sans problème particulier car ces voitures répondent déjà aux normes européennes.

---

**Q18. Puis-je acheter une voiture pour un usage piste uniquement, sans homologation ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Oui. Si le véhicule est destiné exclusivement à un usage circuit (jamais sur route ouverte), il n'a pas besoin d'être immatriculé ni homologué. La voiture sera transportée sur plateau entre votre domicile et le circuit. Ce cas d'usage concerne notamment :
- Les versions "Cup" ou "GT3" racing de Porsche, Ferrari, McLaren
- Les voitures trop émissives pour que le malus soit justifié (piste uniquement)

Nous importons régulièrement des voitures de circuit pour des clients particuliers et professionnels. Aucune homologation ou carte grise requise — juste le dédouanement.

---

**Q19. Y a-t-il un risque que la voiture soit saisie à la douane ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Ce risque existe si les formalités sont mal gérées — mais c'est précisément pourquoi vous passez par un professionnel. Avec Tokyo Motors :
- Tous les documents d'export japonais sont en ordre (déregistration légale, certificat d'exportation)
- La déclaration en douane est préparée et déposée par notre transitaire agréé
- La valeur déclarée est la valeur réelle (nous ne pratiquons pas la sous-déclaration, qui est illégale et expose à de lourdes pénalités)
- Nous travaillons avec des transitaires spécialisés en véhicules de luxe depuis plusieurs années

Aucun de nos véhicules n'a jamais été saisi depuis notre création.

---

**Q20. Pourquoi acheter via Tokyo Motors plutôt que d'aller moi-même aux enchères japonaises ?**

**Réponse recommandée :**
Les enchères japonaises (USS, TAA, JU, HAA Kobe) sont **fermées aux acheteurs directs étrangers** — il faut être membre, ce qui nécessite une adresse commerciale japonaise et le statut de négociant automobile enregistré. Il est donc impossible pour un particulier étranger d'enchérir directement.

De plus, même si c'était possible :
- Les rapports d'inspection sont en japonais
- Les délais de paiement sont de 48h en JPY
- La logistique d'export est complexe (documents, JETRO, transitaires)
- L'homologation française requiert une expertise locale

Notre valeur ajoutée : **accès total au marché japonais**, transparence totale des coûts, expertise RTI/homologation, et accompagnement de A à Z.
