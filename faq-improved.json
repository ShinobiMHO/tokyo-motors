        "question": "Is it legal to import a Ferrari / Lamborghini / Porsche from Japan to the USA?",
        "answer": "Yes, it's completely legal. European luxury cars sold on the Japanese market (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, McLaren, Bentley) are European-manufactured vehicles — not JDM-only models. They were originally built to meet international safety and emissions standards. This means EPA and DOT compliance is significantly simpler compared to true JDM-only vehicles. We handle all documentation, EPA Form 3520-1, and DOT Form HS-7 as part of our service. Every car we export arrives legally registered in your name.",

        "question": "What is the 25-year rule, and does it apply to my car?",
        "answer": "The 25-year rule allows any vehicle over 25 years old to be imported to the USA without needing to meet current FMVSS or EPA emission standards — for example, a 1998 Ferrari F355 is now fully eligible. However, Tokyo Motors specializes primarily in newer luxury vehicles (2000s to present) which do NOT qualify under the 25-year rule. These vehicles require EPA/DOT compliance. Because we handle European supercars built to international specs, the compliance process is well-established and manageable — unlike obscure JDM models. We guide you through every step.",

        "question": "Does a Japanese-market Ferrari or Lamborghini meet US EPA/DOT standards?",
        "answer": "European luxury cars sold in Japan were manufactured to meet European emissions standards (Euro 5/6), which are comparable to US EPA standards. While they don't come with exact US-spec labels, they can be certified through an Independent Commercial Importer (ICI) or through manufacturer compliance letters. For major marques like Ferrari and Porsche, manufacturer compliance documentation is often available. We work with experienced ICI partners to handle this efficiently. Costs typically range from $2,000–$6,000 for a major European supercar — significantly less than for true JDM vehicles.",

        "answer": "Per US Customs and Border Protection (CBP): Passenger cars: 2.5% of the declared value (e.g., $5,000 on a $200,000 Ferrari). Trucks/SUVs: 25% (rarely applies to supercars). No additional luxury tax at federal level. State sales tax is due at registration in your home state. Note: import duty is based on the purchase price, not the US market value — buying a Ferrari at auction for $80,000 means duty on $80,000, not the US retail value. This is one of the significant financial advantages of importing from Japan.",

It typically arrives 4–6 weeks after the car is cleared. We can advise on your specific state's rules.",

        "answer": "Japan has a highly developed auction system with major houses including USS, TAA, JU, Aucnet, and HAA Kobe (which specializes in imports and left-hand drive). Each vehicle receives a detailed inspection grade from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Grade 4.5/5 means excellent condition; Grade R/RA means repaired accident — we avoid these for supercars. You don't physically visit, but you receive: detailed inspection reports (translated to English by us), multiple high-resolution photos, mileage verification, service history notes, and any known defects listed. For luxury supercars, we also arrange pre-purchase inspections by independent Japanese specialists upon request.",

        "answer": "Main risks and mitigations: 1) Hidden damage — mitigated by reputable auction houses and optional independent pre-purchase inspections. 2) Odometer fraud — rare in Japan due to strict regulations; we verify via Shaken records. 3) Compliance surprises — we assess compliance risk BEFORE you bid. 4) Currency fluctuation — we give locked total estimates and move quickly. 5) Losing a bid — we bid on multiple lots and typically find the right car within 2–4 auctions. Japan's auction system is actually one of the most transparent and regulated used car markets in the world.",

        "answer": "Several factors create this price differential: 1) Japanese depreciation culture — Japanese owners trade in frequently, creating supply. 2) Low-mileage examples — Japanese owners typically drive less. 3) Market conditions — Japan has an oversupply of premium used vehicles. 4) Some Japanese luxury cars are right-hand drive, reducing local resale value. Example: A 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia might sell at Japanese auction for ~$100–120K, while the same car in excellent condition retails for $130–160K in the US.",

We use RoRo (Roll-on/Roll-off) shipping for driveable vehicles — cars are driven on/off the ship rather than lifted by crane, which is the safest method. In the rare event of damage, marine insurance covers repairs. We document the vehicle's condition thoroughly before loading with photos and video.",

        "answer": "Japanese-market Ferraris are typically Euro-spec vehicles imported to Japan by Ferrari's Japanese distributor. They share the same mechanical platform as Euro/global-spec cars. Key differences from US-spec: speedometer in km/h (can be recalibrated), headlight adjustment may need minor modification, potentially right-hand drive on some older models, emissions documentation in Japanese (we handle translation and compliance). For most modern Ferraris (post-2000), the difference is minimal and compliance is straightforward.",

The Show and Display exemption (NHTSA) allows certain vehicles of unique historical or technological significance to be imported and driven up to 2,500 miles/year. This applies to specific models deemed collectible. Approval requires a NHTSA petition. We can assess whether your target vehicle qualifies. Note: this limits road use significantly.",

For European supercars sold in Japan, ICI work often involves certifying that the vehicle's emissions system meets EPA standards, making minor software or hardware modifications if needed, and issuing a compliance label. For European-origin supercars (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, McLaren), the ICI process is typically streamlined because these manufacturers have established EPA compliance documentation.

Lamborghini Huracán — similar 15–25% differential. Porsche 911 GT3 — Japan often 20–30% below US prices. McLaren 720S — Japan 15–25% below US.

Additionally: Japanese Shaken (vehicle inspection) records track mileage at each inspection every 2 years; auction inspection reports note any inconsistencies; service records show mileage at each service visit; modern vehicles have electronic odometers that are harder to tamper with.

However: we offer a comprehensive pre-export inspection on every vehicle; we recommend specialist extended warranty programs for exotic cars (CARCHEX, Endurance, or exotic-specific providers); many European supercar dealers in the US will service Japanese-market vehicles — they're the same mechanical platform; factory Ferrari/Lamborghini/Porsche service centers accept these vehicles.",

Pour les supercars européennes importées du Japon, la RTI est obligatoire pour obtenir la carte grise française. La procédure implique : dossier technique complet transmis à la DREAL, tests UTAC (sécurité, émissions, freinage), pour les véhicules post-2006 un test d'émissions, passage du contrôle technique, demande de carte grise via ANTS. Nous prenons en charge la totalité de cette procédure avec nos partenaires homologateurs.",

TVA : 20% sur (valeur en douane + droits de douane). Exemple pour une Ferrari 458 achetée 80 000€ : valeur en douane ~82 000€, droits de douane 5 330€, base TVA 87 330€, TVA 17 466€. Total taxes import : ~22 800€.

Exemples : Ferrari 458 (~320 g/km) → malus 50 000€–60 000€+. Lamborghini Huracán (~290 g/km) → 40 000€–50 000€. Porsche 911 Carrera (~200 g/km) → 5 000€–15 000€.
